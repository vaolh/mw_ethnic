This replication 

## Software

I used [Stata](http://www.stata.com) 18.5 SE on macOS Sequoia (version 15). I had to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which is available on the AppStore. All of my code was written on [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) or on the [Stata](http://www.stata.com) Do-File editor.

## Replication Instructions

-Download or clone this repository using the buttons above or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

-Open Unix/Linux/MacOSX command line. I had zsh - Version 2.14 (455) at the time of this project.

-To do this, you can press Command + Space and write terminal.

-Run the following, if you have not already
```bash
brew install wget
```
-Then, simply type
```bash
make
```
-The Makefile will run all of the code needed to replicate my results from scratch.
